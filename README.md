### User Interface Overview

Upon launching Ipe, you'll encounter the main window comprising:

- **Canvas**: The primary drawing area.
- **Toolbars**: Located at the top, these provide tools for selection, transformation, and object creation.
- **Properties Panel**: Situated on the left, this panel allows you to adjust attributes like stroke and fill color, pen width, and text size.
- **Layers Panel**: Also on the left, this panel manages the layers of your document.

### Basic Drawing Operations

1. **Creating Shapes**:
   - To draw a rectangle:
     - Click the rectangle tool in the toolbar.
     - Click on the canvas to set the first corner.
     - Move the mouse to define the opposite corner and click again to complete.
   - Similarly, you can create circles, lines, and polygons using their respective tools.

2. **Adding Text**:
   - Select the text tool (represented by a "T" icon).
   - Click on the canvas where you want to place the text.
   - A dialog will appear; enter your text here. For mathematical expressions, enclose them in `$` symbols to utilize LaTeX formatting.

3. **Transforming Objects**:
   - Use the selection tool (arrow icon) to select an object.
   - With the object selected, you can move, rotate, scale, or stretch it using the respective tools in the toolbar.

### Snapping and Alignment

Ipe offers robust snapping features to ensure precise alignment:

- **Snap to Grid**: Align objects to the grid points. Toggle this by pressing `F12`.
- **Snap to Vertex**: Align to existing vertices in your drawing. Activate with `F4`.
- **Snap to Intersection**: Snap to the intersection of two objects. Activate with `F6`.

The secondary cursor (a small green cross) indicates the snapping point.

### Working with Layers

Layers allow you to organize your drawing by separating different elements:

- **Creating a Layer**: In the Layers panel, click the "New" button to add a layer.
- **Switching Layers**: Select the desired layer in the Layers panel to make it active. New objects will be added to this layer.
- **Visibility**: Toggle the visibility of layers by checking or unchecking them in the Layers panel.

### Exporting Your Work

Once your drawing is complete:

- **Saving**: Save your work in Ipe's native format (`.ipe`) to preserve editability.
- **Exporting to PDF**: To include your figure in a LaTeX document or for general use, export it as a PDF by selecting `File > Save As` and choosing the PDF format.
